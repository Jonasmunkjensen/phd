This repository documents the process of my PhD project, running from **October 2025 to September 2028**.  
The goal is to provide a transparent and organized platform where collaborators and partners can follow the project’s progression. This repository also serves as a contribution to the principles of **open science**.

## Research Overview

The PhD consists of three papers, each employing different scientific methods. Each paper and the dissertation will have its own dedicated repository for meta data, scripts, analyses and manuscript development:

- 📄 [Paper 1: RCT](https://github.com/Jonasmunkjensen/paper1) - *A randomized controlled trial evaluating the added benefits of incorporating structured high-intensity interval training into diabetes self-management programs.*  

- 📄 [Paper 2: Qualitative study](https://github.com/Jonasmunkjensen/paper2) - *A qualitative study exploring what is at stake when individuals with type 2 diabetes decide whether or not to engage in training.*  

- 📄 [Paper 3: Register-based study](https://github.com/Jonasmunkjensen/paper3) - *A register-based study investigating participation in diabetes self-management and exercise programs, as well as whether these programs increase physical activity compared to non-participants.*  

- [Dissertation](https://github.com/Jonasmunkjensen/dissertation)

## Repository Structure

This repository serves as the **central hub** for project planning, milestones, and shared resources.  

```

├── plan/                  # Project plan, timelines, milestones
├── meetings/              # Agendas, notes, and reports

```

## Progress Tracking
Progress across the three studies will be documented in this repository, allowing supervisors and collaborators to stay informed about the ongoing work in the other projects.

- **Plan and milestones**: The `plan/` folder contains timelines and milestone documents.  
- **Meeting notes**: The `meetings/` folder keeps records of discussions and decisions.  
- **To-do tracking**: The `todo/` folder is used for task lists and progress logs for the project.

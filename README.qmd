This repository documents the process of my PhD project, running from **October 2025 to September 2028**.  
The goal is to provide a transparent and organized platform where collaborators and partners can follow the projectâ€™s progression. This repository also serves as a contribution to the principles of **open science**.

## Research Overview

The PhD consists of three papers, each employing different scientific methods:

- ðŸ“„ [01-rct.qmd](01-rct.qmd)  
  *A randomized controlled trial evaluating the added benefits of incorporating structured high-intensity interval training into diabetes self-management programs.*  

- ðŸ“„ [02-qualitative.qmd](02-qualitative.qmd)  
  *A qualitative study exploring what is at stake when individuals with type 2 diabetes decide whether or not to engage in training.*  

- ðŸ“„ [03-register.qmd](03-register.qmd)  
  *A register-based study investigating participation in diabetes self-management and exercise programs, as well as whether these programs increase physical activity compared to non-participants.*  

Each paper and the dissertation will have its own dedicated repository for data, analyses, and manuscript development:
- [Paper 1: RCT](https://github.com/Jonasmunkjensen/paper1)  
- [Paper 2: Qualitative study](https://github.com/Jonasmunkjensen/paper2)  
- [Paper 3: Register-based study](https://github.com/Jonasmunkjensen/paper3)
- [Dissertation](https://github.com/Jonasmunkjensen/dissertation)

## Progress Tracking

- **Plan and milestones**: The `plan/` folder contains timelines and milestone documents.  
- **Meeting notes**: The `meetings/` folder keeps records of discussions and decisions.  
- **To-do tracking**: The `todo/` folder is used for task lists and progress logs.

## Working with git

Instead of the slow proces off staging, commiting and pushing through the window tap, it can be done through the terminal. 

- Staging: git add .
- Committing: git commit -m "the commit masseage"
- Pushing: git push
- Pulling: git pull
- Get status on local and and main branch: git status

OBS! Use google and not chatgpt - if you need help to find commands.
